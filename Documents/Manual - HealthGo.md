# User's Manual

## Project Name
* Analyzing the effect of activities and step count on sleep patterns

## Log in and Sign up
* Go to sign up with a new user if you have not signed up before
![loginPage](./pictures/000.png)
* The user profile will be stored in the MongoDB

### Dashboard screen
* Tap on the "Connect to fitbit" and "Refresh the data" buttons to connect to the fitbit API and load the yearly data for machine learning. 
* This step will take a while ï¼ˆ~10 seconds) for the data loaded. 
* If you continue clicking "Refresh the data", it will shows "data have not complete loading, please wait for 10 seconds and click refresh again"
* Once the console shows "Year Sleep Data Is Ready Now, Click the Machine Learning Module to Do Prediction", you will see the yearly data for activities and sleep efficiency
* Now you can navigate to the MACHIINE LEARNING module for sleep prediction.

### MACHINE LEARNING screen
* Click the Predict button to start machine learning to predict sleep quality.
* Machine Learning module will use user's hisotorical data to train the model.
* The module will use the training model to predict the sleep quality based on today's activities.
* This module uses the live data from fitbit API.
* This screen also shows the sleep quality (good, fair, poor) distribution in a year and the correlation coefficient between activities and sleep efficiency.

### Sleep Prediction screen
* Click the Sleep Prediction button to let use manual input any activities data for predicting.
* This module is based on KNN algorithm to do prediction
* This module also uses the static fitbit data from csv format as training data

### Daily Data screen
* Tap on the "Connet to fitbit" and "Refresh the data" buttons to connect to the fitbit API 
* You will see today's activities including steps, sedentary, light, fairly, very active minutes, distance, floors,  calories burned, sleep efficiency, minutes asleep and minutes to fall asleep.
